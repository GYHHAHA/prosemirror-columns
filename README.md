# prosemirror-columns

This is a ProseMirror plugin that allows you to create multiple columns in the editor. It also supports resizing columns and add/remove single column. The implementation is largely inpired from [prosemirror-tables](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror-tables). Thanks to [Marijn Haverbeke](https://github.com/marijnh) and all the contributors for their amazing work!
